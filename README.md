# Hangman

Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.
This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

Hangman Game is my first Python project that helps me implement my knoweldge into a hands on experience and opening the path of many more and complex programming projects.


Hangman Game is developed in a way that computer chooses a random word of list of words and the user needs to guess a letter of that word.
Starting by default of 5 lives or right of 5 mistakes, furthermore more than 5 wrong guesses, the game is over the player losses.
