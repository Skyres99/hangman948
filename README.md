# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

Hangman is my first Python project that helps me implement my knoweldge into a hands on experience and opening the path of many more and complex programming projects
